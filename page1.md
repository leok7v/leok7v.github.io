Objective
----

I am always open to innovative and exciting software projects opportunities. I would love to contribute and solve challenging problems. Clarity, correctness, completeness, simplicity and robustness are my forever priorities in software design and implementation.

Clarity
----

Clear understanding of a problem in all it's intricacies leads to correct solution.

Correctness
----

Correct solution is like a proven theorem. Once the proof is achieved further maintenance should be minimalistic to none.

Completeness
----

Code is not complete until it really solves the whole problem.

Simplicity
----

"Simple can be harder than complex: you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end..."

Robustness
----

Code does not run in isolation. There are always some assumptions of ever changing environment the code should be always ready to deal with.
