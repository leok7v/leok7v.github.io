MyPublisher (2001 – 2002)
---

I developed very first version of BookMaker desktop application for Windows (now MyPublisher). 
Event driven UI code was written from scratch in a very plain C++ w/o using of MFC or ATL or other heavy frameworks. 
The code was pure Win32 with the only dependencies on GDI, User, Kernel, Windows Shell and WinInet. 
The code base was about 50,000 lines of C++ code resulting in <1MB download executable.
Later MyPublisher frequently approached me for  future improvement of existing codebase with small short time contracts.


Access Softek (2001)
--- 

Short term project: Implemented first version of iPod mini-port USB driver stack for Windows-98 (VxD) and Windows-2000.


Next Venue - later iBeam (2000)
---

Designed and implemented from scratch NextEncoder - multi-stream, multi-threaded video/audio industrial strength encoder running on multi-processor servers under Windows-NT using Osprey video cards. NextEncoder was capable of simultaneously encoding or transcoding multiple video/audio feeds into Real Media and Windows Media formats. Small encoder server farm has been successfully used in production environment for over an year.
Later Next Venue has been acquired by iBeam Inc.



ImageAXS (1994 – 1999)
---

ImageAXS was developed by a small startup company in Alameda CA that has been known by a succession of names: AXS, DCI, Digital Arts and Sciences and later merged with Gallery Systems.
I started development of ImageAXS for Windows 3.1 (16-bit) and later for Win-32 platform. ImageAXS feature-set was very similar to early versions of modern Google Picasa desktop application.
In the later stages of development ImageAXS team grew up to 4 software engineering and couple of QA engineers.
I was also involved in a variety experimental projects relying on ImageAXS codebase. E.g. DiCOM imaging for medical digital X-Ray photography.
