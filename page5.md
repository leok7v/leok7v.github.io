that later became a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T, also doing business as AT&T Interactive
initiated first mobile app YP for Blackberry and Android in 2007-2009.

I was first developer to work on pre-release Android G1 platform.
In collaboration with AT&T server team I've architected and implemented from 
scratch the very first version of YP Mobile application for Android and released 
it to Google PlayStore.

My personal contributions to the code were in the areas:

 * Implemented asynchronous integration of mobile code with Microsoft Virtual Earth.
 * Implemented UI layouts algorithms (similar to Swing layouts) to accommodate dynamic layout of UI on variety of screen sizes and resolutions.
 * Implemented incremented search client.
 * Later mentored and trained couple of junior software engineers. 
 * Hired my own replacement for the future development of the project.

I also helped with code on J2ME version of YP application for Blackberry.

In 2005 I worked for Google in a capacity of senior software engineer in Google Desktop Search (GDS) team.

My contributions were:
 * Performance and security analysis and improvements.

I found both performance and security unsatisfactory presented my results and left the company for the lack of actions upon them.
Two years later in 2007 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Desktop#Security">GDS Security Issues</a> were 
confirmed outside of the company. I was no longer with the company to utter "I've told you so...".
In 2011 the GDS has been discontinued.
