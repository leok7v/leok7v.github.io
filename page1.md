I hate writing resume and love writing code (and even debugging it).
I have been writing code for 40+ years.
So I made a treaty with myself and allowed myself to put together simple 
JavaScript client only `.md` to `.html` 
generating <a href="https://github.com/leok7v/leok7v.github.io/blob/master/ui.js" target="_blank">script</a> that 
allowed to write the rest of the resume in markdown and `vi`.
