Since 2014 I work for <a href="http://www.zspace.com" target="_blank">zSpace</a> Inc.
as a principle software engineer of system software team.

My team and me are responsible for multiple camera head tracking algorithms and driver
integration of stylus IMU algorithms, poses triangulation and delivering 3D data to
end user application written in Unity 3D and/or OpenGL and other GL frameworks via C API.

System software also supports h/w manufacturing process, cameras calibration, overall components testing. 

During my course of duty I have:
 - [x] re-implemented ~~250,000~~ lines of C++ code (Windows only, R&D quality, ridden with STL/ATL/MFC)
 - [x] implemented same functionality in ~30KLoC of pure C99 portable code
 - [x] reworked ~~30,000~~+ lines of OpenCV based C++ triangulation algorithm to **~3,000** LoCs 
 - [x] improved binary code footprint from 500MB to approximately 5MB
 - [x] improved performance from 97% of system CPU utilization to less then 5%
 - [x] reduced build time from 50 minutes to 2 minutes
 - [x] actively maintained several github source code repositories
 - [x] responsible for over 60 posix and Win32 projects
 - [x] performed several thousands commits per year and many hundreds code reviews
 - [x] developed new algorithms for high performance camera blobs detection 
 - [x] assisted porting those algorithms to FPGA
 - [x] developed real time Android Java and Android Native C h/w debug applications 
 - [x] developed real time (less then 5 microseconds) logging
 - [x] implemented native code for AWS S3 analytics data uploads/downloads 
 - [x] resolved problems with oversea hardware manufactures
 - [x] implemented posix complaint hardware tests on both Linux (Embedded Android) and Windows
 - [x] implemented some end user facing UI applications
 - [x] resolved problems with Microsoft and Google related to Windows and Android codebases
 - [x] contributed code to open source projects
 - [x] mentored junior developers
 - [x] actively collaborated and provided fixes for issues in other team high level projects
 - [x] contributed code to some open source projects
