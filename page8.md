Kronos Research Group
---  
1984 – 1994

I have enjoyed being Computer Science Research Fellow at Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Science for 10 years.
I was honored to be one of the four original instigators of Kronos project.
I architected and implemented or took part in implementation of following parts of Kronos Project:
 * original micro-assembler for Kronos firmware implemented on PDP-11 using Oregon Pascal;
 * microcode for variety of Kronos firmware;
 * several versions of Modula-2 compiler;
 * "ex" text editor similar to "vi" and "Emacs";
 * kernel of Excelsior OS (Unix-like);
 * kernel image linker;
 * file system;
 * device drivers (disk, serial, network, video, keyboard, mouse, ...);
 * system utilities (ls, cp, rm, mv, ps, sh, ...);
 * tar/zip style of archiving programs;
 * graphic interface libraries;
 * extensive hardware unit testing framework and test cases;
 * printed circuit board graphic editor;
 * 3D design and modeling system bCad;
 * portable ANSI C compiler and runtime;
 * Kronos virtual machine that allowed Kronos to be emulated running Matryoshka-style inside itself. 
 
Some of the original compiler code is still used in a successful Excelsior JET product line.

1977-1980

I've coded my first ever program in PL/1 on IMB-360 (USSR clone) using punch cards in summer 1977.
I wrote some Fortran-IV, Algol, Pascal, Basic and assembler code moonlighting during my college years.

Education (1980 – 1985)
---  

I received an MS in Math & CS degree from Novosibirsk University with concentration in CS in 1985.
My diploma thesis was “Architecture of portable Modula-2 compiler” (Proof of correctness of semantic representation of type attributes in compiler data structures).
