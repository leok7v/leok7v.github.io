Since 2014 I work for <a href="http://www.zspace.com" target="_blank">zSpace</a> Inc.
as a principle software engineer of system software team.

My team and I are responsible for multiple IR cameras head tracking,
stylus and screen angle IMU data-stream processing and integration, poses triangulation, and delivery of 3D data to
end-user applications via C API.

User facing applications are usually written using Unity 3D, OpenGL/DDX and other GL frameworks.

System software also supports h/w manufacturing process, cameras calibration, overall components testing. 

During my course of duty I have:
 - [x] re-implemented ~~250,000~~ lines of C++ code (Windows only, R&D quality, ridden with STL/ATL/MFC)
 - [x] implemented same functionality in ~30KLoC of pure C99 portable code
 - [x] reworked ~~30,000~~+ lines of OpenCV based C++ triangulation algorithm to **~3,000** LoCs 
 - [x] improved binary code footprint from 500MB to approximately 5MB
 - [x] improved performance from 97% of system CPU utilization to less then 5%
 - [x] reduced build time from 50 minutes to 2 minutes
 - [x] actively maintained several github source code repositories
 - [x] responsible for over 60 posix and Win32 projects
 - [x] performed several thousands commits per year and many hundreds code reviews
 - [x] developed new algorithms for high performance camera blobs detection 
 - [x] assisted porting those algorithms to FPGA
 - [x] developed real time Android Java and Android Native C h/w debug applications 
 - [x] developed real time (less then 5 microseconds) logging
 - [x] implemented native code for AWS S3 analytics data uploads/downloads 
 - [x] resolved problems with oversea hardware manufactures
 - [x] implemented posix complaint hardware tests on both Linux (Embedded Android) and Windows
 - [x] implemented some end user facing UI applications
 - [x] resolved problems with Microsoft and Google related to Windows and Android codebases
 - [x] contributed code to open source projects
 - [x] mentored junior developers
 - [x] actively collaborated and provided fixes for issues in other team high level projects
 - [x] contributed code to some open source projects
