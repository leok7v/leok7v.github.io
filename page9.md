Over the years I have written code in most of the possible and most bizarre styles you can think of.

I never argues with a team about how the code must look as long as team's code style is self consistent and readable.

For myself I've settled on what I've found most convent over the years.

I will use C/C99 as a language to explain the choices made but most of it is well applicable to Java, JavaScript, Rust and almost everything else.
