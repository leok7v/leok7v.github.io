I hate writing résumés and love writing code (and even debugging it).
I have been coding for 40+ years.
So I have made a treaty with myself, allowing me to put together a simple 
client-only <a href="https://github.com/leok7v/leok7v.github.io/blob/master/ui.js" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> 
converting `.md` to `.html` that enabled me to write the rest of the résumé in 
markdown and `vi`.
